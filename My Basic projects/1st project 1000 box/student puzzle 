A) 64   B) 32   C) 31    D) 62'''
#Define a list of 1000 Gift Boxes
r1=0
r2=1000
Gift=list(range(r1+1,r2+1))
#assisgn all boxes were closed at start
for x in range(r1,r2):
    Gift[x]=str(Gift[x])+'-Close'
#increment to for everyone in 1000 freshers
y=0
#Loop for 1000 freshers
for f in range(r1+1,r2):
    y+=1
    #condition to open or close the box 
    for items in range(r1+1,r2):    
        if (items) % (y)==0:
            if 'Close' in Gift[items]:
                Gift[items]=str(Gift[items]).replace('-Close','-Open')
            else:
                Gift[items]=str(Gift[items]).replace('-Open','-Close')
#Counting open boxes              
subs='Open'
